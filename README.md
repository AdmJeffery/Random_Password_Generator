# Welcome to My Random Password Generator!

If you are in need of a password that is more secure, this script will generate one for you on demand. 

## How to Use

The Random Password Generator is simple to use:
1. Click the "Generate Password" button to begin the process.
2. Type in how many characters you would like your password to be.
3. Follow the prompts to determine what kind of characters will be in your password. You will choose from four different types of characters.
4. Your password will be generated in the textbox.

## What I learned

I had two major takeaways from building this generator. The first was how to properly break apart a problem and solve it step by step.  It's far easier to do this than to worry about the whole problem at once.

The second is that there is no shame in asking for help, or having to research more. Coding is a lengthy process and everyone has to figure why something isn't working from time to time.
